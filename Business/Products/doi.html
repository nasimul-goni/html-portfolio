<p>The production of Bogra yogurt involves a traditional method of fermentation that has been passed down through generations. The milk is first heated and then cooled to an optimal temperature. Afterward, a small amount of previously fermented yogurt, known as a starter culture or "dahi," is added to initiate the fermentation process. This starter culture contains live beneficial bacteria that transform the milk into yogurt.</p>
<p>The fermentation process takes several hours, allowing the bacteria to convert the lactose in the milk into lactic acid. This not only gives the yogurt its tangy flavor but also contributes to its thick consistency. The longer the fermentation, the thicker and more flavorful the yogurt becomes.</p>
